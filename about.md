Through the years, and more recently due to the affairs between Arduino LLC and Arduino S.R.L., I have received a lot of questions from people about the history of Wiring and, of course, Arduino.

I want to clarify some facts around the history of Arduino, with proper supported references and documents, to better communicate to people who are interested, about Arduinoâ€™s origin.

As well, I will attempt to correct some things that I have found that has distorted my role or my work by pointing out common mistakes, misleading information, and poor journalism.

Why don't you read [the whole story](/)?
